# Purpose of this repo

The purpose of this repo is to test getting umlauts and other diacritics to work
with GitHub markdown files - as well as other funny things noticed. It seems
that in this repo umlauts do work but in another they do not in all cases. 

Meanwhile using `rdiscount` locally at least when trying to centre links it just
shows the raw markdown rather than the html. Maybe it's `rdiscount` or maybe
it's the way markdown works.

Progress might or might not be made and this might or might not be worked on at
different times depending on other things going on.
